├── pages/              # Page components
└── types/              # TypeScript type definitions
```

### UI Component Library

Medgen AI uses a custom UI component library built on Radix UI primitives, styled with Tailwind CSS. This approach provides:

- **Accessibility**: All components follow WAI-ARIA guidelines
- **Consistency**: Unified design language across the application
- **Flexibility**: Highly customizable components through Tailwind classes
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering and minimal CSS footprint

### State Management

The application uses React Context API for state management, with specialized contexts for different domains:

- **AuthContext**: User authentication state
- **ChatContext**: Chatbot conversation state
- **DiagnosisContext**: Diagnosis session state
- **SettingsContext**: User preferences and API keys

Each context is implemented with a provider component and custom hooks for consuming the context:

```typescript
// Example of AuthContext implementation
const AuthContext = createContext<AuthContextType | undefined>(undefined);

export const AuthProvider: React.FC = ({ children }) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  
  // Authentication logic
  
  return (
    <AuthContext.Provider value={{ user, loading, signIn, signOut, signUp }}>
      {children}
    </AuthContext.Provider>
  );
};

export const useAuth = () => {
  const context = useContext(AuthContext);
  if (context === undefined) {
    throw new Error('useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider');
  }
  return context;
};
```

### Routing Strategy

Medgen AI uses React Router for navigation, with a route configuration that supports:

- **Protected Routes**: Routes that require authentication
- **Nested Routes**: Hierarchical route organization
- **Lazy Loading**: Code splitting based on routes

The routing structure follows the application's main features:

```typescript
const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: '/',
    element: <Layout />,
    children: [
      { index: true, element: <Landing /> },
      { path: 'login', element: <Login /> },
      { path: 'register', element: <Register /> },
      {
        path: 'dashboard',
        element: <AuthGuard><Dashboard /></AuthGuard>
      },
      {
        path: 'chatbot',
        element: <AuthGuard><ChatbotPage /></AuthGuard>
      },
      // Additional protected routes
    ]
  }
]);
```

### Form Handling

Forms in Medgen AI are implemented using React Hook Form with Zod for validation:

```typescript
// Example of a form with validation
const schema = z.object({
  symptoms: z.string().min(3, 'Please describe your symptoms'),
  duration: z.number().min(1, 'Please specify duration'),
  severity: z.enum(['mild', 'moderate', 'severe'])
});

type FormValues = z.infer<typeof schema>;

const DiagnosisForm = () => {
  const { register, handleSubmit, formState: { errors } } = useForm<FormValues>({
    resolver: zodResolver(schema)
  });
  
  const onSubmit = (data: FormValues) => {
    // Process form data
  };
  
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      {/* Form fields */}
    </form>
  );
};
```

### Responsive Design

Medgen AI implements a mobile-first responsive design approach using Tailwind CSS breakpoints. The application is fully functional on devices ranging from mobile phones to large desktop displays, with optimized layouts for each screen size.

## Backend Implementation

### Supabase Integration

Medgen AI uses Supabase as its backend platform, providing:

- **PostgreSQL Database**: For structured data storage
- **Authentication**: User management and JWT-based authentication
- **Storage**: For storing user uploads and generated files
- **Edge Functions**: For serverless backend logic
- **Realtime**: For live updates and notifications

### Database Schema

The Supabase database follows a normalized schema design with the following key tables:

- **users**: User profiles and authentication data
- **medical_history**: User medical history records
- **health_stats**: User health statistics and metrics
- **activities**: User activity logs across the platform
- **api_keys**: User-provided API keys for external services

### Edge Functions

Serverless functions implemented as Supabase Edge Functions handle operations that require:

- **External API Integration**: Proxying requests to OpenAI and other services
- **Complex Processing**: Operations too intensive for client-side execution
- **Security**: Operations requiring secure API keys not exposed to the client

```typescript
// Example Edge Function for OpenAI integration
Deno.serve(async (req) => {
  if (req.method === 'OPTIONS') {
    return new Response('ok', { headers: corsHeaders });
  }
  
  try {
    const { prompt, options } = await req.json();
    const supabaseClient = createClient(Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_URL')!, Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_ANON_KEY')!);
    
    // Verify authentication
    const authHeader = req.headers.get('Authorization')!;
    const { data: { user }, error } = await supabaseClient.auth.getUser(authHeader.split(' ')[1]);
    if (error) throw error;
    
    // Call OpenAI API
    const response = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${Deno.env.get('OPENAI_API_KEY')}`
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        model: 'gpt-4',
        messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }],
        ...options
      })
    });
    
    const data = await response.json();
    return new Response(JSON.stringify(data), {
      headers: { ...corsHeaders, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
    });
  } catch (error) {
    return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: error.message }), {
      status: 400,
      headers: { ...corsHeaders, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
    });
  }
});
```

### Authentication Flow

Medgen AI implements a secure authentication flow using Supabase Auth:

1. User registration with email/password or OAuth providers
2. JWT-based session management
3. Role-based access control for different platform features
4. Secure password reset and email verification

    return model;
  } catch (error) {
    setError(error.message);
    setLoading(false);
    throw error;
  }
};

const analyzeImage = async (imageElement) => {
  if (!model) await loadModel();
  
  // Preprocess the image
  const tensor = tf.browser.fromPixels(imageElement)
    .resizeNearestNeighbor([224, 224])
    .toFloat()
    .expandDims();
  
  // Run inference
